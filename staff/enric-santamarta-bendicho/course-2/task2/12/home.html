        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="maintext">Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
            transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how
            citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be
            transparent.</p>
        <p class="maintext">Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public
            business and spend
            taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and just
            governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their
            Government is doing.</p>
        <p class="maintext">We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
            Government's
            effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and
            public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to
            become actively engaged in American government.</p>
        <p class="maintext">TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We
            solicit public
            feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

            <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
            <p class="maintext">In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible
                to public opinion
                dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist
                doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative
                instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included
                Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution
                (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly
                related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.

            <p class="maintext">Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France
                (1789), freedom of the
                press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in
                constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on
                these
                measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill
                and
                Acton prominent among the latter.</p>

            <p class="maintext">Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice
                and is often linked
                to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the
                first
                freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth
                century
                and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act
                on
                Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</p>

            <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts
                (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
