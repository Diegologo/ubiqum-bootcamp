            <h3> General Information</h3>
            <p> The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in
                Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a
                member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside
                neighborhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
                parents and previous league members.
