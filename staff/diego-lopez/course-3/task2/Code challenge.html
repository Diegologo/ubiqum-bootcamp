/*que array itera menos veces, el primero: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-nested-loop-puzzle/ Both code segments provide same functionality, and the code inside the two for loops would be executed same number of times in both code segments. 
If we take a closer look then we can see that the SECOND does more operations than the FIRST. It executes all three parts (assignment, comparison and increment) of the for loop more times than the corresponding parts of FIRST: 

The SECOND executes assignment operations ( j = 0 or i = 0) 101 times while FIRST executes only 11 times.
The SECOND does 101 + 1100 comparisons (i < 100 or j < 10) while the FIRST does 11 + 1010 comparisons (i < 10 or j < 100).
The SECOND executes 1100 increment operations (i++ or j++) while the FIRST executes 1010 increment operation.
Below code counts the number of increment operations executed in FIRST and SECOND, and prints the counts.

//console.log (018 - 015) por lo visto da 5 porque console piensa que es un float y considera que es múltiple de 8 (por algún motivo)

/*
A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.

For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2. The number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3. The number 20 has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1. The number 15 has binary representation 1111 and has no binary gaps. The number 32 has binary representation 100000 and has no binary gaps.

Write a function:

function solution(N);

that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.

For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap is of length 5. Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
